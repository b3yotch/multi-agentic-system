# 📌 Project Title:
Multi-Tool Research RAG Agent using LangChain, LangGraph, and Groq

# 📌 Project Description:
This project implements a multi-tool Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed for answering complex research queries using up-to-date information from multiple sources. It’s built using LangChain for agent orchestration, LangGraph for managing tool-based workflows, and a LLM hosted on Groq’s inference API for response synthesis.

# 📌 📑 Full Implementation Workflow:
## 🔸 1️⃣ User Query Input
User sends a research question .

## Example: “What are the latest developments in quantum computing?”

# 🔸 2️⃣ Agent Setup with LangChain
Created an LLMChain using Groq’s API endpoint to handle all natural language generation tasks.

Registered multiple Tool classes (LangChain’s Tool abstraction) for:

tavily_search_results_json — online web article search

semantic_scholar_search — academic paper search

arxiv — preprint and research article retrieval



# 🔸 3️⃣ Multi-Step Agent Logic via LangGraph
Utilized LangGraph to manage the sequential execution of the agent workflow:

Define graph nodes for each tool call

A decision node to determine which tools to invoke based on the query

Execution paths for parallel or sequential tool invocations

Data aggregation step to combine tool outputs

LangGraph was ideal here for multi-tool branching and aggregation logic in a RAG setting.

# 🔸 4️⃣ Tool Calls and Retrieval
Each registered tool was invoked by the agent in response to the query.

The outputs include:

Article titles, summaries, URLs from Tavily

Paper titles, abstracts, and links from Semantic Scholar

Paper metadata and summaries from ArXiv

LangGraph manages these tool calls concurrently where possible.

# 🔸 5️⃣ LLM (Groq) Response Synthesis
All retrieved information was passed to the Groq-hosted LLM via LangChain’s LLMChain.

Prompt engineering involved:

Combining all tool outputs into a structured prompt template

Asking the LLM to synthesize a coherent summary, highlight trends, breakthroughs, and list future directions.

# 🔸 6️⃣ Final Output Delivery
The synthesized answer was returned to the user via the interface, complete with:

## Key findings

Industry trends

Challenges and future directions

Optional citations or URLs for further reading
